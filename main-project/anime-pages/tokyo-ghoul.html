      Tokyo Ghoul is set in an alternate reality where ghouls, creatures that
      look like normal people but can only survive by eating human flesh, live
      among the human population in secrecy, hiding their true nature in order
      to evade pursuit from the authorities. Ghouls have powers including
      enhanced strength and regenerative abilities - a regular ghoul produces
      4–7 times more kinetic energy in their muscles than a normal human; they
      also have several times the RC cells, a cell that flows like blood and can
      become solid instantly. A ghoul's skin is resistant to ordinary piercing
      weapons, and it has at least one special predatory organ called a kagune
      (Japanese: 赫子), which it can manifest and use as a weapon during combat.
      Another distinctive trait of ghouls is that when they are excited or
      hungry, the color of their sclera in both eyes turns black and their
      irises red.

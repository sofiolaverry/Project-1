      Kamome Academy is famous for its rumors regarding its Seven Wonders and
      supernatural occurrences. Nene Yashiro, a first-year high-school student
      who loves the occult and wishes for a boyfriend, summons the Seventh and
      most famous Wonder, "Hanako-san of the Toilet", the spirit of a girl who
      allegedly haunts the bathroom and can grant wishes for the right price.

      The story takes place in the fictional city of Orario. The city is home to
      a number of gods who, seeking excitement, chose to limit their divine
      powers in order to experience the hardships of those who reside on the
      mortal world. Each god maintains a retinue of adventurers and support
      personnel drawn from the people of the city known as a Familia. The primary activity of these organisations is
      exploring the labyrinth under the city known as the Dungeon, in order to battle monsters and harvest the crystal shards they
      leave behind when destroyed. These shards are used to craft magic items
      and other treasures; however, they can also be exchanged directly for the
      world's currency. In a fashion typical of role playing games, the power of
      an adventurer is quantified by their level and a number of ability scores.
      By defeating more powerful monsters, an adventurer is able to increase
      their own level and ability scores, as well as unlock special powers known
      as skills

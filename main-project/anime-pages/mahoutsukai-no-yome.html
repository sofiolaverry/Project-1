    <p>
      Having been ostracized by both her relatives and partially by society,
      orphaned Japanese high school student Chise Hatori decides to sell herself
      at an auction in order for somebody else to take her in and have a new
      place to call home. At the auction in London, she is sold for five million
      pounds to Elias Ainsworth, a seven-foot-tall humanoid with an animal skull
      for a head. The magus, who seems closer to a demon than human, either
      brings her the light she desperately seeks or drowns her in ever deeper
      shadows in her new country, Great Britain.

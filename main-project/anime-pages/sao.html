      In 2022, a virtual reality massively multiplayer online role-playing game
      (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online (SAO) will be released. With the
      NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their
      brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with
      their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear were created by Akihiko
      Kayaba. On November 6, 10,000 players log into SAO's mainframe cyberspace
      for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out.

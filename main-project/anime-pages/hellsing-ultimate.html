    <p>
      Hellsing is named after and centered around the Royal Order of Protestant
      Knights originally led by Abraham Van Helsing. The mission of Hellsing is
      to search for and destroy the undead and other supernatural forces of evil
      that threaten the queen and the country. This organization is currently
      led by Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who inherited the
      leadership of Hellsing as a child after the death of her father. She
      witnessed his death which turned her from a once innocent and shy little
      girl to a tough and deadly force. She is protected by the faithful
      Hellsing family butler Walter C. Dornez, a deadly foe in his own right,
      and Alucard, the original and most powerful vampire, who swore loyalty to
      the Hellsing family after being defeated by Van Helsing one hundred years
      before the story takes place. These formidable guardians are joined early
      on in the storyline by former police officer Seras Victoria, whom Alucard
      turned into a vampire.

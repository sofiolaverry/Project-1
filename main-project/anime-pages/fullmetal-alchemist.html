      Fullmetal Alchemist takes place in the fictional country of Amestris. In
      this world, alchemy is one of the most-practiced sciences; alchemists who
      work for the government are known as State Alchemists and are
      automatically given the rank of major in the military. Alchemists have the
      ability, with the help of patterns called transmutation circles, to create
      almost anything they desire. However, when they do so, they must provide
      something of equal value in accordance with the Law of Equivalent
      Exchange. The only things alchemists are forbidden from transmuting are
      humans and gold. There has never been a successful human transmutation;
      those who attempt it lose a part of their body, and the result is an
      inhuman mass. Attemptees are confronted by Truth, a pantheistic and
      semi-cerebral God-like being who tauntingly regulates all alchemy use, and
      whose nigh-featureless appearance is relative to the person with whom
      Truth converses; it is frequently claimed and believed that Truth is a
      personal God who punishes the arrogant.

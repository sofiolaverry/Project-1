      The story takes place in Taishō-era Japan, where a secret society, known
      as the Demon Slayer Corps, has been waging a secret war against demons for
      centuries. The demons are former humans who were turned into demons by
      Muzan Kibutsuji injecting them with his own blood, and they feed on humans
      and possess supernatural abilities such as super strength, powers that
      demons can obtain called "Blood Demon Art", and regeneration. Demons can
      only be killed if they are decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy
      known as Nichirin, injected with poison extracted from wisteria flowers,
      or exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, on the other hand, are entirely
      human; however, they employ special elemental breathing techniques, known
      as "Breathing Styles", which grant them superhuman strength and increased
      resistance. This helps them fight against demons. The strongest Demon
      Slayers are known as the Hashira.

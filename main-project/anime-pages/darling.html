      Darling in the Franxx takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future
      where the remnants of human civilization have abandoned the surface.
      Adults and children exist in contrasting environments from each other.
      Adults live in technologically advanced cities within Plantations and are
      immortal, but procreation and relationships among them have become
      obsolete and undesirable. Artificially-created children, termed
      "parasites", are deprived of individuality and are educated only for
      piloting Franxx in pairs to defend humanity. The children are kept in
      isolation from adult society in environments nicknamed "birdcages", which
      emulate that of a bygone era so that they can develop the emotional
      responses required to pilot Franxx.

    <p>
      In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed
      Energy, which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow
      throughout the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their
      bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the
      birth of Curses,a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is
      to bring harm to humanity. These curses are shown as gruesome monsters.
      Jujutsu Sorcerers are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy
      in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce
      its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and
      use it to perform Cursed Techniques, which tend to be unique to the
      user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain
      Expansion, which the users build a pocket dimension of variable
      size. Inside the domain, all of their attacks will always connect and grow
      in strength.

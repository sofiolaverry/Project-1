      Hi everyone! My name is Sofia Olaverry, but most people call me
      Sofi(Sophie). I'm 23 years old and I'm from Uruguay in South America.
      I love art in all its forms! I really enjoy listening to music, reading books,
      watching movies or series and going to museums. 
      The things I love the most are anime and cats. I have got two cats, Nina and Miri, 
      they are really spoiled :D
